The data is collected from Seattle open data (data.seattle.gov). The data is collected and processed in the following steps:

1. **1.1_Get_All_Parking_Zones.ipynb** Find which blocks have paid parking
2. **1.2_Get_Detailed_Blockface_Info.ipynb**	Get detailed info for each block that has paid parking
3. **1.3_Get_Parking_Data.ipynb**	Retrieve parking occupancy for 'active years' (2018-2019)
4. **1.4_Format_archived_data.ipynb** Process csvs with parking occupancy for 'archived years' (2012-2017)
